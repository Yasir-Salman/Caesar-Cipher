# Caesar Cipher


**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script: `python caesar_cipher.py`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt text.

**Dependencies:**
* `pyperclip` (optional for copying to clipboard)

This Python script implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Â  

The script allows users to encrypt or decrypt text by providing a shift value (key). It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and provides the option to copy the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard.

Key features:

Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher,

User-friendly interface with clear prompts,

Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters,

Optional clipboard functionality for convenience,

Clear and concise code with comments.

This project serves as a basic introduction to cryptography and Python programming concepts.
